# _Marfa_ for Jekyll

#### Demo: [mmarfil.com/](http://mmarfil.com/)

## Screenshot

![screenshot](screenshot/home.png)

This Jekyll theme started as a port of [Cactus](https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus) to my own needs, but I ended up performing a lot more modifications than expected. Some people reached me out and asked if I could share it, so here we are.

#### Disclaimer: I'm only a designer, so please don't expect the code to be pretty.

## Usage
To start your project, [fork this respository](https://github.com/mmarfil/marfa/fork), put in your content, and go!
